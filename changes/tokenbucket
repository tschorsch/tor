  o Major features (performance):
    - Add a new config option DisableOutgoingTokenBucket that avoids the
      "double door effect" of bytes being delayed both when entering and
      exiting a relay. This option shouldn't affect configured bandwidth
      limits, because most data is relayed traffic and only a negligible
      amount is created at the relay itself. Implements part of proposal
      XXX. Implemented by Florian Tschorsch and Björn Scheuermann.
    - Allow configuring the token bucket refill interval to something else
      than the default of 1 second using TokenBucketRefillInterval. Will
      be ignored when Tor was built with Libevent's bufferevents enabled.
      Should only be set along with DisableOutgoingTokenBucket, or we
      might amplify the "double door effect". Implements the other part of
      proposal XXX. Implemented by Florian Tschorsch and Björn
      Scheuermann.
